Based on design calculations with the constraints:
- Band-pass action
- Chebyshev response
- 3dB passband ripple
- 4th order roll off
- f-3dB lower = 279.5 Hz & f-3dB upper = 597.5 Hz (±5%)
- +0.0dB to -3.0dB (±1.0dB) target passband gain
- ±15V supply voltages
- TL082 Op amps
- Output voltage swing > ±10V
